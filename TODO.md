# Wilson TODO

## Current Status (Oct 15, 2025)

**All ENDGAME phases complete** - Full autonomous multi-agent system production-ready.

Latest: Phase 4 autonomous coordination (agents poll tasks, parallel execution, dependency resolution)

### Working System
- 37 tools: filesystem (7), code intelligence (15), web (5), context (6), system (2), orchestration (5)
- 6 agents: Chat, Manager, Research, Code, Test, Review
- Code Agent: AST parsing + compile loops + cross-file awareness + quality gates
- Task management: DoR/DoD validation, dependencies, reviews, autonomous polling
- Context store: SQLite with tasks, artifacts, reviews, communications

## Next Steps

Choose focus area:
1. **ENDGAME Phase 5:** Learning, metrics, templates, cost optimization, rollback
2. **Session Context Phase 2:** Smart context window (if hitting token limits)
3. **Production:** Deployment testing, real-world usage validation

## Future Work

### Chatbot: Async Delegation (Deferred)
Complete Phase 3 from chatbot optimization work.

**Goal:** Non-blocking complex task execution with background processing.

Tasks:
- Return task ID immediately, process in background
- Task status polling via check_task_progress
- Background notifications when task completes
- Task queue management for concurrent tasks

**Infrastructure:** Already exists (TaskQueue, Manager Agent from ENDGAME Phase 1)

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 hours when needed

**Deferred Also:**
- Phase 6: Model optimization (use small models for chat, specialized models for tasks)
- Phase 7: Streaming optimization (immediate token output vs buffering)

### Session Context Phase 2 (Not Started)
Handle long conversations without token limits.

Tasks:
- Sliding window (last N messages)
- Token counting/estimation
- Auto-summarization of old messages
- Important message pinning
- Graceful token limit handling

See DONE.md: "Conversation History Trade-offs"

### Session Context Phase 3 (Not Started)
Resume conversations across restarts.

Tasks:
- Store conversation in DB
- Resume prompt on startup
- Session commands (/clear, /save)
- Searchable history

### ENDGAME Phase 5 (Not Started)
Advanced features.

Tasks:
- Learning from past tasks
- Agent performance metrics
- Task templates
- Cost optimization (model selection)
- Rollback/undo capability

## Completed Phases

### ENDGAME Phase 1: Task Management ✅
Task model, DoR/DoD, Manager Agent, queue system
- 5 tools: create_task, assign_task, update_task_status, get_task_status, list_tasks
- DB schema: tasks, task_reviews, agent_communications
- Integration tests: 13 tests passing

See DONE.md: "ENDGAME Phase 1"

### ENDGAME Phase 2: Specialist Agents ✅
Domain-specific agents with model routing.
- Research Agent (multi-source research)
- Code Agent (production code)
- Test Agent (test design)
- Review Agent (quality assessment)
- File tools: write_file, modify_file, append_to_file
- Agent-specific tool restrictions

See DONE.md: "ENDGAME Phase 2"

### Code Agent Phase 1: Intelligence ✅
AST parsing, symbol search, structure analysis, import management.
- 4 tools: parse_file, find_symbol, analyze_structure, analyze_imports
- Code-aware development

### Code Agent Phase 2: Compilation ✅
Compile-test-fix loops.
- 2 tools: compile, run_tests
- Structured error parsing
- Iterative fixing (max 5 attempts)

### Code Agent Phase 3: Cross-File Awareness ✅
Dependency mapping, pattern discovery.
- 3 tools: dependency_graph, find_related, find_patterns
- Project-aware development
- Learn and match existing code patterns

### Code Agent Phase 4: Quality Gates ✅
Automated quality checks.
- 6 tools: format_code, lint_code, security_scan, complexity_check, coverage_check, code_review
- Production-ready code output

### ENDGAME Phase 3: Reviews ✅
Review processes and quality validation.
- 3 tools: request_review, submit_review, get_review_status
- 6 validators: compilation, formatting, linting, security, complexity, coverage
- Feedback loop with needs_changes status

### ENDGAME Phase 4: Autonomous Coordination ✅
Independent agents with parallel execution.
- 5 tools: poll_tasks, claim_task, unblock_tasks, update_task_progress, get_task_queue
- Atomic claiming prevents races
- Pull model (no manager bottleneck)
- Automatic dependency resolution

## Rollout Strategy

1. Supervised (Current → 3mo): User reviews all tasks
2. Semi-Autonomous (3-6mo): Low-risk autonomous
3. Fully Autonomous (6-12mo): Independent agents
4. Team Mode (12+mo): Multi-user coordination

## Known Challenges

- Agent coordination: Conflicts, duplicate work → DoR/DoD, Manager resolution
- Cost: Multiple models expensive → Small models for simple tasks
- Error propagation: Early mistakes cascade → Validation gates, rollback
- Context limits: Long chains exceed tokens → Smart window (Phase 2), summarization

## Key Decisions

Architecture:
- Self-registering tool plugins
- Purpose-specific model routing
- SQLite context store
- Pull task model (Phase 4)

Conversation:
- 20 turn limit (90% use cases)
- Artifact references over full content
- Phase 2 for power users

Web:
- HTML scraping over API
- Rate limiting (3 concurrent, 500ms stagger)
- Auto-storage for agent sharing

Multi-agent:
- DoR/DoD prevents bad execution
- Right model for right task
- Atomic operations prevent races
